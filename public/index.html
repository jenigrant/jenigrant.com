						<h3 class="header">Exceptional User Centered Design</h3>
						<p class="ui left aligned container">From initial concept to production deployment, I build innovative interfaces that delight users with their ease of use. Project requirements are identified from user research and communication with key stakeholders, then distilled into a plan, using card sorting, whiteboarding, user stories, and other tools to model engaging interfaces. After modeling, it’s on to cohesive design and development strategies to ensure that every feature is first-class.</p>

Using responsive design, progressive enhancement, and the latest in HTML5, CSS3, and Javsacript, I develop robust front-end interfaces that degrade cleanly and seamlessly comply with accessibility initiatives like Section 508 and WAI-ARIA.</p>

						<p>I knew when I built my first web page that I was onto something significant. There was an unharnessed raw power in the simple lines of HTML, the open landscapes of CSS and Javascript. Building for the web isn’t only my profession, it’s my passion. From the latest developments in hardware to corporate level security, I’m constantly seeking to learn more.</p>

						<p>I want to build the latest in interfaces, driven by research and designed for the user experience. I develop with modern Javascript frameworks and design tools for the next generation of experiences. I am a longtime associate of Fortune 50, award-winning agencies, and successful startups alike. An expert in online experiments and multi-stream data analysis, I have a strong background in versatile front-end solutions.</p>

								<h4>Built an online survey that could handle bidirectional language support using asynchronous techiques — three years before AJAX.</h4>
								<p>The Flowserve Customer Satisfaction Survey required bidirectional input for an international audience without specific language support. The resulting application could handle input in both rtl and ltr languages, and the language independent template displayed content properly regardless of directionality. Each set of questions and responses was stored in XML and accessed using asynchronous scripting, and translated into browser-ready HTML with XSLTs. The survey was sent to customers in over 20 different countries, and received the highest response rate of any existing Flowserve customer surveys.</p>

								<h3>iContact Product Pivot</h3>
								<h4>Pivoted a startup into a multi-million dollar company.</h4> 
								<p>Shortly after its first million in sales, iContact decided to transition their product to a more mature UX designed around their customer's needs. After generating competitive analyses of key competitors and target competitive markets, I performed content auditing on existing marketing materials. To facilitate company buy-in of user-centered principles, I worked with back-end development in an Agile environment to create functional design patterns, define user flows, establish sitemaps, and other UX deliverables. Before launch, I conducted focus groups, informal “hallway” usability audits, formal usability testing, and A/B testing in order to verify and validate application features. Trial conversion rates increased by 200% during the first quarter after relaunch and doubled the number of paying customers in a less than year. iContact was named the #1 Marketing Application for 2007 by SEOMoz, then a major industry consulting firm.</p>
