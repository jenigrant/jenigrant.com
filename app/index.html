                                <p>From initial <strong>concept to production</strong> deployment, I build innovative interfaces that delight users with their ease of use. Project requirements are identified from <strong>user research</strong> and communication with key stakeholders, then distilled into a plan, using <strong>card sorting, whiteboarding, user stories</strong>, and other tools to model engaging interfaces. After modeling, it’s on to cohesive <strong>design and development strategies</strong> to ensure that every feature is first-class.</p>

Using <strong>responsive design, progressive enhancement</strong> techniques, and the latest in <strong>HTML5, CSS3, and Javsacript</strong>, I develop robust front-end interfaces that degrade cleanly and seamlessly comply with accessibility initiatives like <strong>Section 508 and WAI-ARIA</strong>.</p>

                        <h3>“Pleasing things work better, are easier to learn, and produce a more harmonious result.” <br> &mdash; Donald A. Norman, Ph.D.</h3>


                        <div class="floatingbox">
                            <p>I was a teenager when I was first introduced to the world of human-computer interaction through Don Norman's seminal work, <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> The <strong>interconnection of social sciences with design and code</strong> was revelatory. I realized that with the advent of the Internet, <strong>humanity is at the intersection of a pivotal moment in time</strong>, where the echoes of my work and others will affect generations to come. I want to contribute to that in a way that <strong>preserves our human dignity</strong> and helps, in its own little way, to <strong>make the world a better place</strong>. </p>

                            <p>With every project, I start by analyzing the available resources and knowledge at hand. Through <strong>competitive analysis and stakeholder interviews</strong> I get to know your business, and your application through <strong>functional analysis, user surveys, and other methods of contextual inquiry</strong>. Together with other staff members, <strong>functional specifications and content requirements</strong> are developed and combined into a cohesive <strong>information and interaction architecture</strong>. Brand standards become design comps, which are then developed into <strong>responsive, full-functioning prototypes</strong>, ready to be implemented into existing software architecture. Each feature is validated, run through usability tests, and reiterated based on feedback gained during this evaluation phase before being deployed. </p>

The resulting application could handle input in both rtl and ltr languages, and the language independent template displayed content properly regardless of directionality. Each set of questions and responses was stored in XML and accessed using asynchronous scripting, and translated into browser-ready HTML with XSLTs. The survey was sent to customers in over 20 different countries, and received the highest response rate of any existing Flowserve customer surveys.</p>

The redesign required production-level front-end and back-end code designed to be accessible on a variety of devices and across a wide spectrum of browser and browser versions, including support for future browser versions, years before such standards were considered to be a natural part of development. I also developed interfaces for interactive Flash-based features and worked with departmental leads and other key stakeholders to ensure both adherence to vendor-based brand guidelines (Nike, Adidas, etc) and commerce-ready data quality standards. Much of the code I produced remained in production for over seven years with no degradation in quality.</p>

                                        <p class="body">Shortly after its first million in sales, iContact decided to transition their product to a more mature UX designed around their customer's needs. To determine specific user pain points, I analyzed months of help desk tickets and conducted a heuristic evaluation of the existing application. After generating competitive analyses of key competitors and target competitive markets, I performed content auditing on existing marketing materials. To facilitate company buy-in of user-centered principles, I worked with back-end development in an Agile environment to create functional design patterns, define user flows, establish sitemaps, and other UX deliverables. Before launch, I conducted focus groups, informal “hallway” usability audits, formal usability testing, and A/B testing in order to verify and validate application features. Trial conversion rates increased by 200% during the first quarter after relaunch and doubled the number of paying customers in a less than year. iContact was named the #1 Marketing Application for 2007 by SEOMoz, then a major industry consulting firm.</p>
