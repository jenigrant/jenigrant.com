                                <h4>Exceptional User Centered Design</h4>
                                <p>From initial concept to production deployment, I collaborate with teams to build innovative interfaces that delight users with their ease of use. I delve into user research to understand the consumer and communicate with key stakeholders to identify project requirements. Project requirements are then distilled into a plan, using card sorting, whiteboarding, user stories, and other tools to model engaging interfaces. After modeling, it’s on to cohesive design and development strategies, executing full-featured prototypes, and employing usability testing to ensure that every feature is first-class.</p>

                                <h4>Talented Front-End Development</h4>
                                <p>I create front-end interfaces that merge an in-depth understanding of some of the web’s most essential technologies with the latest in cutting-edge development. Together with back-end developers, I develop standards-compliant front-ends using responsive design and progressive enhancement techniques. Whether it’s with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript or one of the many current libraries and frameworks available, I excel at generating well-documented, production-level code that degradates cleanly and seamlessly complies with accessibility initiatives like Section 508 and WAI-ARIA.</p>

                                <p>Design and development aren’t just day jobs to me; user centered principles are my passion.  I love knowing that what I do helps people achieve their everyday goals. I have a voracious hunger for knowledge, and constantly seek out future trends in design and development. I am a strategy veteran who has consistently used innovative thinking to problem solve, storytell, and create dynamic, user-friendly interfaces. I have worked with multidisciplinary teams in agile startups and staid corporations alike. I am comfortable and familiar with a wide variety of tools (especially Adobe Creative products), on nearly every major computing platform available.</p>

                        <h3>“Pleasing things work better, are easier to learn, and produce a more harmonious result.” — Donald A. Norman, Ph.D.</h3>

                        <p>I grew up with a love of fine art, and became passionate about human-centered design when I first read Dr. Norman’s <cite>The Design of Everyday Things</cite> as a teenager. During that same period of time I delved into the wonders of programming; these worlds collided when I learned of the field of human-computer interaction. The interconnection of social sciences with design and code was revelatory. I realized that with the advent of the Internet, humanity was at the intersection of a pivotal moment in time, where the echoes of my work and others will affect generations to come. I wanted to contribute to that in a way that preserved our human dignity and helped, in it’s own little way, to make the world a better place. </p>

                        <p>With every project, I start by analyzing the available resources and knowledge at hand. What are your company’s strengths and weaknesses? What assets exist, and what needs to exist? Who are the customers, the builders, the support? Through competitive analysis and stakeholder interviews I get to know your business, and your application through functional analysis, user surveys, and other methods of contextual inquiry. Together with other staff members, functional specifications and content requirements are developed and combined into a cohesive information and interaction architecture. Brand standards become design comps, which are then developed into responsive, full-functioning prototypes, ready to be implemented into existing software architecture. Then each feature is validated, run through usability tests, and reiterated based on feedback gained during this evaluation phase before being deployed. </p>

                        <h3>Real World Experience; Real World Results</h3>

                        <p>While a contractor the US Postal Service, I was tasked with building an application for several hundred help desk associates, allowing them to virtually manage, update, and share documentation describing thousands of procedures. Beginning with interviews from team leads and senior employees, I surveyed departments about current pain points and consulted with stakeholders to gather key requirements, including the newly issued federal accessibility standards, Section 508. I developed fully-functional interface prototypes, sitemaps, storyboards, and worked with back-end developers to consolidate code branches into a single deployment-ready codebase. Because of initial buy-in from pivotal members of staff, help desk workers were trained and able to use the application in a matter of hours after deployment. </p>

                        <p>At soccer.com, I championed evolving the existing codebase  —  then an unwieldy 10,000 pages, with no separation of presentation from content —   into a semantic standards-based model. I wrote production-level front-end and back-end code designed to be accessible on a variety of devices and across a wide spectrum of browser and browser versions, years before such standards were considered to be a natural part of development. I also developed interfaces for interactive Flash-based features and worked with departmental leads and other key stakeholders to ensure both adherence to vendor (Nike, Adidas, etc) based brand guidelines and commerce ready data quality standards. Much of the code I produced remained in production for over seven years.</p> 

                        <p>While at iContact, I was one of two UX designers tasked with creating an experience intended to pivot the nature of the then-startup’s product. I analyzed months of help desk tickets in order to determine specific user pain points and conducted a heuristic evaluation of the existing application. After generating competitive analyses of key competitors and target competitive markets, I performed content auditing on existing marketing materials. In order to facilitate company buy-in of user-centered principles, I worked with back-end development in an Agile environment to create functional design patterns, define user flows, establish sitemaps, and other UX deliverables. Before launch, I conducted focus groups, informal “hallway” usability audits, formal usability testing, and A/B testing in order to verify and validate application features. Trial conversion rates increased by 200% during the first quarter after relaunch and doubled the number of paying customers in a less than year. iContact was named the #1 Marketing Application for 2007 by SEOMoz, then a major industry consulting firm.</p>
