						<h3>Exceptional User Centered Design</h3>
						<p class="ui justified container">From initial concept to production deployment, I build innovative interfaces that delight users with their ease of use. Project requirements are identified from user research and communication with key stakeholders, then distilled into a plan, using card sorting, whiteboarding, user stories, and other tools to model engaging interfaces. After modeling, it’s on to cohesive design and development strategies to ensure that every feature is first-class.</p>

						<i class="large yellow computer icon inverted circular"></i>
						<h3>Talented Front-End Development</h3>
						<p class="ui justified container">I create well-documented, production-level code that merge an in-depth understanding of some of the web’s most essential technologies with the latest in development techniques. Using responsive design, progressive enhancement, and the latest in HTML5, CSS3, and Javsacript, I develop robust front-end interfaces that degrade cleanly and seamlessly comply with accessibility initiatives like Section 508 and WAI-ARIA.</p>

						<h3>Passion for Strategy &amp; Interaction</h3>
						<p class="ui justified container">Design and development aren’t just day jobs to me; user experience is my passion.  I love knowing that what I do helps people achieve their everyday goals. I have a voracious hunger for knowledge, and constantly seek out future trends in technology. My passion has led me to consistently use innovative thinking to problem solve, storytell, and create dynamic, user-friendly interfaces using a wide variety of tools and techniques on every major computing platform.</p>

						<p class="body">The Flowserve Customer Satisfaction Survey required bidirectional input for an international audience without specific language support. The resulting application could handle input in both rtl and ltr languages, and the language independent template displayed content properly regardless of directionality. Each set of questions and responses was stored in XML and accessed using asynchronous scripting, and translated into browser-ready HTML with XSLTs. The survey was sent to customers in over 20 different countries, and received the highest response rate of any existing Flowserve customer surveys.</p>

						<p class="body">Sports Endeavors, the largest direct soccer retailer in North American, launched a complete redesign of their retail site with a deadline set at the start of their busiest season. The redesign required production-level front-end and back-end code designed to be accessible on a variety of devices and across a wide spectrum of browser and browser versions, including support for future browser versions, years before such standards were considered to be a natural part of development. I also developed interfaces for interactive Flash-based features and worked with departmental leads and other key stakeholders to ensure both adherence to vendor-based brand guidelines (Nike, Adidas, etc) and commerce-ready data quality standards. Much of the code I produced remained in production for over seven years with no degradation in quality.</p>

						<p class="content">One of two designers who created a user experience that pivoted the nature of a startup’s SaaS product into an industry leader and a multi-million dollar company.</p> 
						<p class="body">Shortly after its first million in sales, iContact decided to transition their product to a more mature UX designed around their customer's needs. To determine specific user pain points, I analyzed months of help desk tickets and conducted a heuristic evaluation of the existing application. After generating competitive analyses of key competitors and target competitive markets, I performed content auditing on existing marketing materials. To facilitate company buy-in of user-centered principles, I worked with back-end development in an Agile environment to create functional design patterns, define user flows, establish sitemaps, and other UX deliverables. Before launch, I conducted focus groups, informal “hallway” usability audits, formal usability testing, and A/B testing in order to verify and validate application features. Trial conversion rates increased by 200% during the first quarter after relaunch and doubled the number of paying customers in a less than year. iContact was named the #1 Marketing Application for 2007 by SEOMoz, then a major industry consulting firm.</p>
